generate a model

`rails g model question email:string body:text`

same, but with RESTful routes

`rails g resource question email:string body:text`
-> generates migration in `db/migrate/...`
-> generates model in `models/question.rb`
edit the migration

![](screens/2019-01-18-14-49-57.png)

## run the migrations

`rake db:migrate`

`rails console`

ActiveRecord lines
get translated to SQL

** in rails, all @instance variables are available in the views **

```
class HomeController < ApplicationController
  def index
    @questions = Question.all
  end
  ...
```

```
<div class="container">
  <% @questions.each do |q| %>
    ...
    # method
    <%= q.gravatar %>" width="80" height="80">

    # props
    <%= q.email %> said:
        <%= q.body %>
```


### RAILS helpers
built-in helper: `time_ago_in_words`
`<%= time_ago_in_words q.created_at %>`


### Rails handles routes by convention

`routes.rb`
  ...
  `resources :questions`
  
  -> this will handle all requests for question


form submit points to
`/questions`,
need to edit `QuestionsController` (which was generated before)

when submit form

![](screens/2019-01-18-17-11-57.png)

we can see all of the routes for question resource
but none defined for answers

### generate an answer resource

1. generate resource
` rails g resource answer question_id:integer email:string body:text`

2. migrate
`rake db:migrate`

*NOTE*
`rake routes` - to see all routes

![](screens/2019-01-18-17-14-12.png)

![](screens/2019-01-18-17-16-20.png)

3. define `create`, `show`, etc

![](screens/2019-01-18-17-23-37.png)

4. make sure form params follow the structure expected
by the controller's safe param method

![](screens/2019-01-18-17-19-45.png)

5. ... and all required params are supplied
